## My process

I first wrote the HTML (which I had to correct multiple times later!). Then I wrote the CSS and finally the Javascript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I created an overlay for the main image hover effect then I switched it on and off by using Javascript. (I do not know if this could have been done without using JS, just by using plain CSS. If yes, then I would love to know how!)

So, I learned how to do an overlay effect, I guess? I had never attempted it before this project. I am sure I did not do it perfectly, but it's a start.

### Continued development

I will be definitely using the overlay technique in future projects. I am not sure if it was the perfect solution for this project, but I find the effect itself useful and appealing.

I also struggled a lot with optimizing it for smaller screens and I am still not satisfied with the result. I will attempt to make it scale better by using relative units like ems and rems.
